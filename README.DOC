This is a wordpress plugin setup to enable protected areas within content.

The sections can be protected by the following methods:

Using a password
Based on user level

This will use shortcodes.

Admins can see the sections without the password.

Shortcode parameters:

usepass = yes / no (if you want to use a password to protect this section. Default: no)
uselevels = yes / no (if you want to enable this section for specific user levels. Default: no)
password = "12345" (add your password here to unlock the protected section. Default: "")
levels = "subscriber, contributor" (add the levels which can see this section. Default: "")

Eg:

[wpsectionpass usepass=yes uselevels=yes password="" levels=""]
